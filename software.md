## Software on PLEIADES
Our centrally provided software installations are offered through [modules](software/modules).
You can load modules from the [EESSI Projects](https://www.eessi.io/) through `/cvmfs/software.eessi.io`, or local centrally provided modules located in `/beegfs/tools`.
Some commercial software, e.g. TotalView or ARM Forge, is available as well.
Additionally, many groups and users install and use their own software in their respective `${HOME}` directories.
