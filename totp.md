# 2 Factor Authentication on Pleiades

## Why?

To increase security significantly, [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) requires a 2nd piece of evidence to log into the Pleiades cluster. 

We currently offer [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) (Time-based one-time password) logins, which usually require no additional hardware on the user's side - any smartphone is enough. Some people call that "Google Authenticator" because Google implented one reference of this method. But the [standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) is completely open.

Once activated, you need to use an app on your smartphone which will present you a time-limited code, which you have to enter **additionally** before you will be granted access.

Example of such a login:

```
Torsten-Harenbergs-MacBook-Air-2:~ harenber$ ssh fugg2.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de
(harenber@fugg2.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de) Password:
(harenber@fugg2.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de) Verification code:
Last login: Mon Mar  6 10:29:23 2023 from guckloch.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de

## How you can use it.

### Step 1: Install an App on your smart phone

You will need an app implementing the TOTP standard. There are plenty available, however we would strongly recommend to use a free and open-sourced app.

#### Android

For Android, we recommend [FreeOTP+](https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus) which is available from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.liberty.android.freeotpplus) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/org.liberty.android.freeotpplus/).

Once installed, you need to configure FreeOTP+ to protect your TOTPs. Most modern smartphones offer the use of biometrics like using your fingerprint.  That makes it really easy to use FreeOTP+. But you can also choose a password to protect the access.

#### iOS

For Apple devices, [2FAS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/2fa-authenticator-2fas/id1217793794) is probably your best choice.

### Step 2: configure TOTP on Pleiades

This step is only required **once**

Log into any Pleiades Login node (whep users: please use higgs or top for that) and type `google-authenticator`.

The program will ask you a couple of questions, the answers are in **bold**:

`Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n)` **y**

`Warning: pasting the following URL into your browser exposes the OTP secret to Google:
  https://www.google.com/chart?` *Just ignore the link*

Then you will be presented a QR Code. *This is the important part. You will need to scan that with your phone's TOTP app.*

`Your new secret key is: ` *this is your secret key. Write it down and keep it in a safe place*\
`Your verification code is ` *write this down*\
`Your emergency scratch codes are:` *write them also down and keep them in a safe place*

`Do you want me to update your "/common/home/harenber/.google_authenticator" file? (y/n)` **y**

`Do you want to disallow multiple uses of the same authentication`\
`token? This restricts you to one login about every 30s, but it increases`\
`your chances to notice or even prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (y/n)` **n**


`By default, a new token is generated every 30 seconds by the mobile app.`\
`In order to compensate for possible time-skew between the client and the server,`\
`we allow an extra token before and after the current time. This allows for a`\
`time skew of up to 30 seconds between authentication server and client. If you`\
`experience problems with poor time synchronization, you can increase the window`\
`from its default size of 3 permitted codes (one previous code, the current`\
`code, the next code) to 17 permitted codes (the 8 previous codes, the current`\
`code, and the 8 next codes). This will permit for a time skew of up to 4 minutes`\
`between client and server.`\
`Do you want to do so? (y/n)` **n**

`If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force`\
`login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.`\
`By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.`\
`Do you want to enable rate-limiting? (y/n)` **n**

> **Shortcut** If you're sick of answering each question one by one, here is the shortcut passing the right options to the command above: `google-authenticator -u -t  -D -f -W`

> **ATTENTION WHEP USERS** You have two home directories: the NFS-based /common/home/*username* on top/higgs and /beegfs/*username* on the cluster nodes. Please configure TOTP on top/higgs and once you're finished with the step above, copy the file `.google_authenticator' to your /beegfs/*username* directory.

### Step 3: inserting the secret key into your phone app

This is the easiest step. Use the QR scan method of your app (in FreeOTP+ on the bottom right) and scan the QR code from your terminal. Done.

If that does not work, you may add the secret key by hand:

[<img src="assets/img/freeotp_add_secret.png" alt="FreeOTP screenshot" width="300">](assets/img/freeotp_add_secret.png)

### Step 4: enter the verfication code now every time you login

When you login to any Pleiades login node, you will be asked now two questions:

`(account@loginnode.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de) Password:` **Here you enter your usual password**\
`(account@loginnode.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de) Verification code:` **Here you enter the time limited code provided by your smart phone app**

# FAQ

- Are passwordless logins impossible with TOTP?

   No. If you're using ssh keys, you can use them as usual. TOTP only affects password-based logins.

- What if I loose my phone / get a new phone?

   If you've written down the secret, you can restore your TOTP on a different device. In addition, FreeOTP+ on Android allows you to export and import your secrets, 2FAS on iOS offers backup/restore in iCloud. In fact, it maskes sense to install a TOTP app on two devices in case you cannot use one. If you fear that you phone is compromized / stolen, you can reset TOTP (see next question).

- I think my secret is compromized.

   You can reset TOTP by deleting `.google_authenticator` in your home directory and start again from step 2 above.

- How to I get rid of this?

   Just delete `.google_authenticator` in your home directory.
   
- TOTP sucks, why don't you provide FIDO2 keys?

   Currently, some of our users still require Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 which makes it nearly impossible to use FIDO2. 
   
- What are these `emergency scratch codes` that I should write down?

   These codes *replace* a TOTP secret *once*. So if you cannot use TOTP for whatever reason, each of these codes will replace the TOTP secret. But once you use a code, this one gets invalid (that's why they are called *scratch codes*). 

- HELP! HELP! HELP! I locked myself out!
