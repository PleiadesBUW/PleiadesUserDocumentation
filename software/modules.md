## Software Modules
We use [LMod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/) environment modules to provide software installations to our users.
After login, you can use the `module` command to find and load software:
```
$ module --help
Usage: module [options] sub-command [args ...]

Options:
  -h -? -H --help                   This help message
.
.
.
```

For example, if you need a recent version of GCC and CMake and want to see available versions, you can execute:
```
$ module spider GCC CMake
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GCC:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++, libgcj,...).

     Versions:
        GCC/4.9.3-2.25
        GCC/8.3.0
        GCC/9.3.0
        GCC/10.2.0
        GCC/10.3.0
     Other possible modules matches:
        GCCcore

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CMake:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      CMake, the cross-platform, open-source build system. CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package software.

     Versions:
        CMake/3.15.3
        CMake/3.16.4
        CMake/3.18.4
        CMake/3.20.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To find other possible module matches execute:

      $ module -r spider '.*GCC.*'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "CMake" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.
  For example:

     $ module spider CMake/3.20.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Use the specific versions of GCC and CMake, to see details on how to load these modules:
```
$ module spider GCC/10.3.0 CMake/3.20.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GCC: GCC/10.3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++, libgcj,...).


    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "GCC/10.3.0" module is available to load.

      2021a
      2021a-norpath

To finally load the software you can call `module load 2021a GCC/10.3.0 CMake/3.20.1`:
```
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 10.3.0
Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO

$ which gcc
/beegfs/Tools/easybuild/stacks/rome/2021a/software/GCCcore/10.3.0/bin/gcc

$ which cmake
/beegfs/Tools/easybuild/stacks/rome/2021a/software/CMake/3.20.1-GCCcore-10.3.0/bin/cmake
```

You would use such a `module load` command, whenever you prepare your environment for interactive work, as well as in batch job scripts.


### Background Information
The module visibility is following a hierarchical naming scheme.
It means that software only becomes visible to the `module available` command, after it's dependencies are loaded.
`2021a` represents a "meta module", acting as an entry point into a given version of the software stack.
A new software stack is released about every 6 months and older stacks will be phased out over time.
To ensure reproducibility, you can still access old software stacks by calling `module use /beegfs/Tools/easybuild/old-meta-module/`, but we recommend to use the most recent versions whenever possible.

The hierarchical naming scheme can make it difficult to discover available software.
If you look for something specific, just use `module spider <software>` to get an overview and `module spider <software>/<version>` to learn what dependencies have to be loaded.
You can also look into `/beegfs/Tools/easybuild/stacks/rome/2021a/software/` to get a general idea of the available software (as of 2021-11-18):

We build the software stacks with [EasyBuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/).
If you are missing a software, please check if it is available in [EasyBuilds list of supported software](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/version-specific/Supported_software.html#list-software).
In this case it might be trivial for us to provide it as well.
Otherwise, we hope you understand that building unsupported software may require some time or might not be feasible for us.
If you have made your own modules, e.g. in `/beegfs/<user>/modules`, you can add the path via `module use /path/to/my/modules`.


### Troubleshooting
Occasionally you are in a situation where you know a new module just has been made available, but the `module` command claims it is not.
In this case you can try `module --ignore-cache spider`, since available module locations might be cached in your user directory.

If you load many modules, you might experience an increased latency in your interactive shell commands.
This is caused by a growing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, when modules from the `2021a` (and any `-norpath`) stack are loaded.
The growing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is causing frequent search operations on our `/beegfs`, which can be slow if many file system operations occur in parallel, e.g. through other users jobs.

We are working on mitigations of this issue and as a workaround you can try to use the software from the `2021a-rpath` stack instead.
Here, the whole software stack is built with `RPATH`, i.e. lookup paths of library dependencies are compiled into all binaries and the lookup through `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not necessary anymore.
There are a couple of drawbacks though:
  - The `2021a-rpath` stack is not necessarily suited to build your own software, e.g. by loading GCC and CMake. In this case you would have to consider using RPATH in your build as well. For simplicity, try to use the `-rpath` stack only if you intend to use the application, but not build further software against it.
  - The `2021a`(`-norpath`) and `2021a-rpath` stack might be out of sync. Please tell us if you need a certain module that is available in one, but no the other.
