## PLEIADES Acknowledgement
Our suggested wording for a PLEIADES acknowledgement in your paper is:

   > The computations were carried out on the PLEIADES cluster at the University of Wuppertal, which was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).
